    description: "The modern Alfa Romeo Giulia marks the brand's return to the rear-wheel drive sports sedan segment. Built on the Giorgio platform, it features a range of engines from a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (200-280 HP) to the high-performance Quadrifoglio's 2.9L twin-turbo V6 producing 505 HP. The Giulia is known for its distinctive Italian styling, excellent handling characteristics, and driver-focused experience. A mid-cycle refresh in 2020 brought interior quality improvements and updated technology features while maintaining the car's dynamic driving characteristics. The Giulia has received critical acclaim for its performance, particularly in Quadrifoglio form, which set a NÃ¼rburgring lap record for production sedans at its launch."
